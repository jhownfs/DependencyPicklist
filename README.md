## USE CASE

Sometimes we need to customize standard dependency picklist Salesforce to use custom logic for some reasons, standard picklist values limit, standard dependency limit, or more...So I created this component to solve this problem, using custom LWC and Custom metadata.

You can modify and adjust according to your needs.


## HOW THIS COMPONENT WORKS

You can use this component inside any object, but it's important this object has field that contain the same name, to insert values selected.
